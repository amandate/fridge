## About the Project
A food tracking application to organize perishables by expiration date with the goal to help prevent 
food waste and encourage explorative cooking at home. Incorporates user interaction via command line 
for commands (such as adding food, creating profiles, creating food storages etc). Also integrates a 
system to save a state (such as a profile) so users don't lose progress when they rerun the application.

## Running the Application


## Project Structure
The Project is divided into packages, exemplified below.
```
- src
    - package1
        - __init__.py
        - module1.py
    - package2
        - __init__.py
        - module2.py
```

### Adding a new package
When adding a new package, be sure to add an empty `__init__.py` file into it.

## Testing
File structure should mirror the structure of packages in /src.
