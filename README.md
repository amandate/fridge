## About the Project

## Running the Application

## Project Structure
The Project is divided into packages, exemplified below.
```
- src
    - package1
        - __init__.py
        - module1.py
    - package2
        - __init__.py
        - module2.py
```

### Adding a new package
When adding a new package, be sure to add an empty `__init__.py` file into it.

## Testing
File structure should mirror the structure of packages in /src.
